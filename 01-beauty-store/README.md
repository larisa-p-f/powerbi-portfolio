# Beauty & Skincare E-Store Report

## Project Overview
This project analyzes sales volumes and profitability for a **global skincare and beauty e-store**.  
The business case (provided by [ZoomCharts](https://zoomcharts.com/en/microsoft-power-bi-custom-visuals/challenges/fp20-analytics-september-2024)) set the following strategic goals:
- Achieve an **average annual profit margin of 15%** across all product groups  
- Reach **20% annual overall sales growth**, with a higher target of **30% for the corporate segment**  
- Ensure **at least $400K annual sales per market**  

The report highlights whether these KPIs were met and provides actionable insights into **profitability, discount strategy, and geographic performance**.

## Key Insights
- **Profit Margin Trends** → Overall profit margin for all years was above the 15% target in later years, but fell from being consistently above 24% for 2020, 2021, 2022, to 16% in 2023
- profit increased every year but fell in 2023 w a yoy of ~17%
- despite sales rising every year (sales yoy in 2023 was 19.9%)-> meaning costs raised in 2023
- overall sales growth target of 20% was met in 2021 and 2022 (both years above 26%) but not met in 2023
- average order value increased in 2021 and 2022, but fell in 2023 by 12 dollars
- asia pacific largest market by sales (throughout all years), with africa consistently being the last
- asia pacific roughly ~4x bigger than africa in 2023 (sales)
- corporate sales growth target of 30% not met in any of the years
- africa was the only market to not meet 400k goal in 2023
- first market to reach 400k goal was asia pacific in 2022, no other market in any of the other years met this goal
- europe the fastest growing market (sales), usca the slowest
- asia pacific largest in sales, but europe most profitable
- across all ears, europe has the highest profit margin (22%), asia pacific the lowest (13%)
- profit margin for all markets fell in 2023
- europe was the only market where profit did not fall in 2023
- corporate > consumer > self-employed shares of profits throughout all years and markets

- usa the most profitabl country after all years ~208k, 1.3 mill in sales, 21% of sales from california
- 
- **Discount Strategy** → Non-discounted products consistently outperformed discounted items, showing discounts eroded profitability.
- Discounted items lose money overall: discounted profit margin is negative most years and fell to −5.5% in 2023, while non-discounted margin stayed positive (but also dipped to 28.1%).
- ~45% of sales revenue came from discounted lines each year—so those negative margins matter a lot. Hair care and Home & Accessories: discounted margins are strongly negative (≈ −15% and −18%).

Body care: discounted margin barely above break-even (~3.6% vs 36.9% when full price). Make up and Face care: discounted margin still positive (~12% and ~16%), but far below full-price margins (~47%).
